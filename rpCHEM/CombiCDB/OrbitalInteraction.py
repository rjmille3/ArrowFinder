"""Simple interaction models for fundamental reactions of
orbital overlap interactions.

Key functions for external callers:

    moveOrbitalElectrons:
        Fundamental reaction unit, moves the electrons from a given filled orbital
        to an unfilled orbital, rearranging the electron configuration (bonds, formal charges)
        accordingly.
    undoMoveOrbitalElectrons:
        After a call to moveOrbitalElectrons, this should undo the changes made
        in electron configuration, reverting the composite molecule to its prior state.
    perceiveInvertedOrbitals:
        After a call to moveOrbitalElectrons, perceive the orbitals in the
        new composite molecule state that when applied would effectively invert
        the transformation and revert the molecule to its prior state.
    reactionSmilesFromOrbitalPair:
        Apply a filled-unfilled orbital pair and produce the reactions SMILES
        string that represents the change.

    ElementaryStepData:
        Class / struct to manage core information describing an orbital interaction

    one molecular orbital to another.  Function should figure out
    all of the substeps necessary to properly represent the change,
    including consideration for whether the orbitals are atomic (non-bond) or molecular (bond).
    
    Assume this is called in a sensible manner however.  
    Cannot use any arbitary orbitals as the arguments.  
    The source orbital (sourceOrb) must contain electrons to move, no empty orbitals allowed.  
    The target orbital (targetOrb) must have space for electrons to move in.
    In general this means it is either an empty orbital or a bond orbital which can
    displace the existing bond electrons to the neighbor atom.  No lone pairs allowed.
    
    Additionally support a special case for bond dissociation reactions.
    The source and target orbital should be based on the same bond, with polarity
    of electron movement based on the target orbital polarity.
    Alternatively, specifying "None" for the sourceOrb as a sentinel object 
    will be interpreted as a bond dissociation reaction for the targetOrb bond.
    
    Returns the bond just created or added to by the move.

    If the arrowObjList is provided, then items will be added for the
    collection of ElectronArrow objects representing the respective "arrow-pushing" 
    mechanism diagram.  These will only make sense if the atoms involved have 
    non-zero atom mapping index labels.
    Make this optional as excessive ElectronArrow object instantiation can be 
    relatively expensive, and is often unused.
    
    To handle aromatic compounds correctly, we clear the flags upon entry and then try to reinstantiate upon exit.
